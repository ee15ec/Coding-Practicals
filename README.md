# Coding-Practicals
This repository contains all the work towards the practicals for the module GEOG5990M. This module teaches the basic in computer programming and the Python programming language.   
Each practical of the module has been worked through and each folder contains a 'ReadMe' file to explain the aim of each model for the practical. The techniques and methods learnt through the practicals have led to the creation of a final agent based model. Again, this model is explained further under the 'ReadMe' file.
