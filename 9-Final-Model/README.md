# My Final Model

'Finalmodel.py' is the final agent based model created using techniques learnt through the previous practicals.
This model includes 'Agents' which move, eat their envrionment, and share it with their neighbours if they are within a certain distance of each other. It also includes 'Wolves' which also move within the environment and eat the Agents if they are in the same location. The model is shown in an animation and outputs the information into the files 'Agent.txt', 'wolf.txt', and 'environment.txt'. These files containt the x and y axis of each agent and wolf, along with the agent stores for each model run. The 'environment.txt' file records the remaining environment after each model run.
