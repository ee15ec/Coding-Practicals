# Communication
Code for the Communication practical

Model7.py along with agentframework7.py are for the main practical. For this, the agents are able to talk to each other by altering each other's variables.     
The extension work leads to a new model ARGVmodel7.py which uses the command line to define the number of agents, iterations, and neighbourhood values.
