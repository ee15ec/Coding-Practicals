# Graphical User Interfaces
Code for the Graphical User Interface/Web-scraping practical.     
Model10.py and Agentframework10.py together create part one of the graphical user interface practical. This gives our model a graphical user interface.   
Webdata.py and agentframework11.py together create part two of the practical. This new model retrieves data from a webpage to use for the starting point of agent x and y co-ordinates and so the agent framework is changed as necessary.
