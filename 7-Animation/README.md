Code for animation/behaviour practical.   
Model8.py and agentframework8.py together cover the practical work. For this, matplotlib is used to present the model as an animation.   
The extension work includes model9.py and agentframework9.py. In this extension 'Wolves' are created which can eat (and remove) the agents if they are in the same location.
