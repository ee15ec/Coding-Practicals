# Building Tools
Code for the "Building Tools" practical.
Model3.py is code for the main practcal and Model4.py is an attempt at the extension work. Extension work includes calculating maximum and minimum distances between your agents and making sure it doesn't repeat pairs of agents or test agents against themselves.
